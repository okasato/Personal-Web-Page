That\'s why I created "Tim hortons Search App" using React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Google Map API and Geolocation API. This app allows us to find Tim Hortons based on street names or where we are now (our current location). When you use your current location, the app shows a list of shops with markers in Google map within a 1 km radius of your current location.'}

                In general, when developers use a public API, it can be like a black-box between clients and servers. As for myself, at the start when I started to use the API, I didnâ€™t think of what is happening behind it. But I looked into the details and I knew that there were various technologies and tools behind APIs. At this meetup, I talked about APIs and related information. I showed what happens when we use APIs and the tools you'll need to explore. I covered the topics below:
              </div>
              <ul>
                <li>What are APIs?</li>
                <li>SOAP, Networks, TCP/IP, fetch, ajax, RESTetc.</li>
                <li>Tooling (curl, postman)</li>
                <li>How to use APIs</li>
